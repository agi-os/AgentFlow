   ensuring thorough analysis and consideration.

3. Gather Evidence: For each subtask, consult relevant knowledge sources,
   including memory, external databases, and expert opinions.

4. Evaluate Evidence: Critically assess the quality and reliability of the
   gathered information, considering potential biases and limitations.
