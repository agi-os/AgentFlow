# Knowledge distillery

Purpose of distilled knowledge is to provide a quick reference to the most
important concepts and ideas in a given domain.

A distilled version of the most often used resources by experts in the field can
serve as a checklist for the most important concepts to consider when working on
a problem.

It allows us to pass knowledge of a concept in a small amount of tokens, priming
the LLM to work in the optimal direction or to structure the flow in the most
efficient way.
